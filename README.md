💠 **Tasks:**

   ⭐ Task 1: Project Overview (GOAL of our project)
  
   ⭐ Task 2: Import Libraries and datasets 
   
   ⭐ Task 3: Explore dataset (through various graphs)
   
   ⭐ Task 4: Prepare the data for Facebook Prophet 
   
   ⭐ Task 5: Understand the theory and intuition behind Facebook prophet 
   
   ⭐ Task 6: Develop model and make predictions - Part A
   
   ⭐ Task 7: Develop model and make predictions - Part B (Region Specific)


💠 **Learnt about new technologies:**

    ✔️ Facebook Prophet time series prediction tool
    
    ✔️ Worked with python libraries: *numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn*
    
    ✔️ Learnt to transform dataset to Facebook Prophet format &	Built a time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet.
    

💠 **What is Facebook Prophet ?**
  * Prophet is an open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science Team.
  * It is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.
  * It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

💠 **Advantages of Facebook Prophet:**
  * Accurate and Fast
  * Automatic (No need of data pre-processing)
  * Domain Knowledge Integration
